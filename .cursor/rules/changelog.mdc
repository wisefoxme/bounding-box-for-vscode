# Changelog (Keep a Changelog)

Maintain [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) per [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Format

- **File**: `CHANGELOG.md` in the project root.
- **Header**: State that notable changes are documented here, and that the format is based on Keep a Changelog (and optionally [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)).
- **Order**: Latest version first. Keep an `## [Unreleased]` section at the top for changes not yet released.
- **Versions**: Use `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO 8601). Example: `## [1.2.0] - 2025-02-01`.
- **Change types** (use only sections that have entries; omit empty ones):
  - `### Added` — new features
  - `### Changed` — changes in existing behavior
  - `### Deprecated` — soon-to-be removed
  - `### Removed` — removed features
  - `### Fixed` — bug fixes
  - `### Security` — vulnerabilities

## When to update

- When adding or removing a feature: add an entry under `## [Unreleased]` in the appropriate type (`### Added`, `### Removed`, etc.).
- When fixing a bug: add under `### Fixed` in `[Unreleased]`.
- At release: turn `[Unreleased]` into a versioned section (e.g. `## [1.0.0] - 2025-02-01`) and leave a new empty `## [Unreleased]` at the top.

## Example (Unreleased)

```markdown
## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Support for COCO format import.
### Fixed
- Bounding box coordinates when image is scaled.
```

## Don’t

- Don’t use raw git log dumps as the changelog.
- Don’t use ambiguous dates (prefer `YYYY-MM-DD`).
- Don’t leave important deprecations or removals out of the changelog.
