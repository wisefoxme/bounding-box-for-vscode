# Testing Rules

- **New features**: Every new feature must have corresponding unit tests. Do not merge code that adds behavior without tests.
- **Removed features**: When removing a feature, remove its tests and ensure the rest of the test suite still passes.
- **Coverage**: Keep test coverage above 80% for the codebase. Run the test suite before considering work done.
- **Test runner**: Use the existing `@vscode/test-cli` and `@vscode/test-electron` setup; run tests with `npm test`.
- **Core logic**: Parsing, coordinate conversion, and settings resolution must have unit tests; integration tests can cover activation and commands.
